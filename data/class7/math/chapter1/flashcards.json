    "q": "What is the additive inverse of an integer?",
    "a": "The **additive inverse** of an integer is the number that, when added to it, gives zero.\n\nExample: Additive inverse of 5 is -5, because 5 + (-5) = 0"

    "q": "What happens when you multiply two negative integers?",
    "a": "When you multiply two negative integers, the result is **positive**.\n\nExample: (-3) × (-4) = +12"

    "q": "What is the rule for dividing integers with different signs?",
    "a": "When dividing integers with **different signs** (one positive, one negative), the result is **negative**.\n\nExample: 20 ÷ (-4) = -5"
