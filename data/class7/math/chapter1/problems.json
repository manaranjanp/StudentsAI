    "solution": "**Given:**\n- Initial depth: -300 m (below sea level is negative)\n- Ascends: +125 m (going up is positive)\n- Descends: -75 m (going down is negative)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nFinal depth = -300 + 125 + (-75)\n\n= -300 + 125 - 75\n\n= -300 + 50\n\n= **-250 m**\n\n**Answer: The submarine is at 250 m below sea level**"

    "problem": "Verify the distributive property: 7 × [9 + (-5)]",
    "solution": "**Left side:** 7 × [9 + (-5)]\n\n= 7 × [9 - 5]\n\n= 7 × 4\n\n= **28**\n\n**Right side (using distributive property):** (7 × 9) + [7 × (-5)]\n\n= 63 + (-35)\n\n= 63 - 35\n\n= **28**\n\n**Since both sides equal 28, the distributive property is verified: a × (b + c) = (a × b) + (a × c)**"
