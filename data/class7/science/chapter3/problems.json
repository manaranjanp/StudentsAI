    "solution": "**Given:**\n- Distance (d) = 120 km\n- Time (t) = 3 hours\n\n**(a) Average speed in km/h:**\n\nAverage Speed = Total Distance / Total Time\n\nAverage Speed = 120 km / 3 h = **40 km/h**\n\n**(b) Average speed in m/s:**\n\nFirst, convert km to m and hours to seconds:\n- 120 km = 120 × 1000 = 120,000 m\n- 3 hours = 3 × 60 × 60 = 10,800 s\n\nAverage Speed = 120,000 m / 10,800 s = **11.11 m/s** (approximately)\n\n*Or use the conversion factor: 1 km/h = 5/18 m/s*\n\n40 km/h = 40 × (5/18) = **11.11 m/s**"

    "solution": "**Given:**\n- Final speed = 60 km/h\n- Time for first part = 10 minutes = 10/60 h = 1/6 h\n- Time for second part = 20 minutes = 20/60 h = 1/3 h\n\n**(a) Distance during first 10 minutes:**\n\nAssuming uniform acceleration, average speed = (0 + 60)/2 = 30 km/h\n\nDistance = Speed × Time = 30 × (1/6) = **5 km**\n\n**(b) Distance during next 20 minutes:**\n\nSpeed is constant at 60 km/h\n\nDistance = 60 × (1/3) = **20 km**\n\n**(c) Average speed for entire journey:**\n\nTotal Distance = 5 + 20 = 25 km\n\nTotal Time = 10 + 20 = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours\n\nAverage Speed = 25 / 0.5 = **50 km/h**"
