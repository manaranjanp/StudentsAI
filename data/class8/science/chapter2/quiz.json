    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "rationale": "Wide foundations **reduce pressure** on the ground by increasing the area over which the force (weight) is distributed. This prevents the building from sinking."

      "Pushing a cart"

    "correct": 0,
    "rationale": "When you suck through a straw, you reduce the pressure inside the straw. **Atmospheric pressure** then pushes the liquid up the straw into your mouth."
