    "q": "What is force?",
    "a": "**Force** is a push or pull acting upon an object as a result of its interaction with another object.\n\nUnit: Newton (N)"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is pressure?",
    "a": "**Pressure** is the force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area.\n\nFormula: Pressure = Force / Area\n\nUnit: Pascal (Pa) or N/m²"
  },
  {
    "q": "What happens to pressure when the area decreases?",
    "a": "When the area **decreases**, the pressure **increases** (if force remains constant).\n\nExample: A sharp knife cuts better than a blunt one"
  },
  {
    "q": "What is atmospheric pressure?",
    "a": "**Atmospheric pressure** is the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere.\n\nAt sea level: ~101,325 Pa or ~1 atm"
  },
  {
    "q": "State Newton's Third Law of Motion",
    "a": "**Newton's Third Law:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nExample: When you push a wall, the wall pushes back with equal force"
